      <description>What is terraform? Terraform is a widely used Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. This is a tool that is cloud agnostic, therefore can interact with a wide range of supported cloud providers.
Why use terraform? As an engineer you may find yourself having to provision several resources on a cloud platform. If you were to create it manually through the CLI or a webportal you would find that creating copies of the same resource can be time consuming.</description>
