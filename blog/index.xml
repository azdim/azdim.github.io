      <description>Introduction As a DevOps/Cloud engineer, git is an essential tool in our arsenal. A git commit is an action that we execute daily, hourly and sometimes more often than that. I hope that you, the reader, are not committing code every second - that would be shocking. Committing code not only creates a snapshot of the work you have done but it also describes the work you have done in a commit message.</description>

      <description>What is terraform? Terraform is a widely used Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. This is a tool that is cloud agnostic, therefore can interact with a wide range of supported cloud providers.
Why use terraform? As an engineer you may find yourself having to provision several resources on a cloud platform. If you were to create it manually through the CLI or a webportal you would find that creating copies of the same resource can be time consuming.</description>
